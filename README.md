# Personality Prediction using Deep Learning
<body>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3><p style"text-align: justify">				
This system is a desktop application which predicts the personalities of different people. Particularly, adopting methods of predicting personality traits based on core 
concepts and algorithms of deep learning are the main objectives. Moreover, face detection and recognition along with expressions prediction are also included. This 
system is based upon Agile methodology and the technologies that are used in this system are Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras, VGG-16, NN, Haarcascade, Naive Bayes,
SVM and PyQt5. Many methods are used to assess a person's character and personality. Some are through the body movements, body language, handwriting and signatures. 
Assessing a person's character and personality will be the main objective in order to produce a better system to predict personalities. Some popular measures of 
personality are not useful because they are unreliable or invalid. The proposed system will enable a more effective way to predicate the personality of a person by 
using the machine and deep learning algorithms with the help of images and textual datasets.</p>
